üéì I'm a student at [University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu).

üìù <mark>To edit your own home page</mark>, edit the [`about.md`](https://github.com/dillonma/dillonma.github.io/blob/master/_pages/about.md).

## What to Include on Your Homepage

The `about.md` home page is the landing page of your site and should have a number of important things on.

 - What is your degree (and background) in, what field, specializations, certificates, relevant courses?
 - What would you call yourself and what are your interests? Are you a field ecologists, a human geographer? Are you interested in cities, biodiversity, etc?
 - What are the most important relevant expereince to back the above up? Maybe provide a link to your CV?
 - What are some projects that connect to your interests and experience?

Don't forget to use section headers (hashtags) to differentiate sections. So you might have a Selected Experience section in H2, then H3 sections for the above bullet points.

Another tip: in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lJhXJCUYCc), Boris used emojis effectively in both the headings and in the text.
