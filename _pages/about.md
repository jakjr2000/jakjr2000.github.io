Greetings everybody! My name is Jack, and I welcome you to my website.

I'm a 23-year resident of Annapolis, Maryland, the state capital. Currently, I'm currently pursuing two degrees in Political Science and Geography and Environmental Studies from the [University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu). Some of my other areas of interest include political campaigns and elections, history, and meteorology.
